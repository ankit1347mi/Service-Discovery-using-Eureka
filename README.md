Service Discovery
<br>
This Project consists of Product Service , Order Service and Inventory Service.
<br>
to communicate between two microservice we are using Web Client which is used to call inventory service from order service.
<br>
this is a multimodule project it consist of 3 microservices and is useful to maintain the dependency in parent module.
<br>
One more feature which we used is Service Discovery using Eureka which is
 a service registry is a vital component for managing and locating services within a distributed system. The purpose of a service registry is to keep track of the network locations (IP addresses and ports) of available services. This enables services to dynamically discover and communicate with each other, allowing for better scalability, flexibility, and fault tolerance.
